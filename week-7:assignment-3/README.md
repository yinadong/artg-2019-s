## Assignment 3

Refactor the `Cartogram` module so that it's modular and configurable. The configurable properties should include the following:
- Width and height
- Year
- The size of the nodes
Optionally, can you make the force layout configurable as well? What are some other force configurations you can think of?

Complete answers will be posted by Wednesday next week.
